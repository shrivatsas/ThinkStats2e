## Anecdotal evidence failures
1. Small number observations - We might need a large sample for meaningful differences.
2. Selection bias - People may join discussion due to biases curiosities.
3. Confirmation bias - People contribute affirmations.
4. Inaccuracy - Misremembered, misrepresented, repeated inaccurately, etc..

## Statistical Approach
1. Data collection
2. Descriptive statistics
3. Exploratory data analysis
4. Estimation
5. Hypothesis testing

## Cross sectional vs Longitudinal
Cross-Sectional - Captures a snap-shot of a group at a point in time.  
Longitudinal - Observes a group repeatedly over a period of time.

## Representative vs Oversampled
Representative - Every member of the target population has an equal chance of participating.  
Oversample - A subset of the population has higher representation than others.

## Codebook
Documents the design of the study, the survey questions, and the encoding of the responses

## Recodes vs Raw data
Recode are data added to the sample based on some analysis of Raw data. Derived data.  
In general it is a good idea to use recodes when they are available, unless there is a compelling reason to process the raw data yourself.

## Step 1: Transformation (Data cleaning)
Convert data to form acceptable for analysis.

## Step 2: Validation
Compute basic statistics and compare with published results.

## Step 3: Interpretation
The level of statistics and the level of context.  
What do these numbers mean statistically.  
What do these numbers mean in a real world sense - for the respondents / society / ...
